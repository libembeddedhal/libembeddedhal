   * pre-scalars before the counting register.
   *
   * <b>How to handle these errors:</b>
   *
   * - In cases where the program is scanning for the fastest delay, this is to
   *   be expected. The error will report the minimum possible delay which can
   *   then be assigned. Same for the maximum possible delay.
   *
   * - In most other cases, this is usually a bug in the code and cannot be
   *   handled in code and should be treated as such. Drivers using a timer, if
   *   they need an exact number will not be usable with this timer if it throws
   *   this error, which will either require another timer that can perform this
   *   work be used or increasing the clock rate fed into the timer in order to
   *   increase its frequency range.
