 * @brief Serial communication protocol hardware abstract interface.
 *
 * Use this interface for hardware that implements a serial protocol like UART,
 * RS232, RS485 and many others that use a similar communication protocol but
 * may use different voltage schemes.
 *
 * Due to the asynchronous nature of serial communication protocols, all
 * implementations of serial devices MUST buffer received bytes using DMA or
 * interrupts. A thread should not be used as this generally greatly increases
 * the ROM and RAM cost of using library.
 *
 * All implementations MUST allow the user to supply their own buffer of
 * arbitrary size, such that the amount of buffered data can be tailored to the
 * needs of the application.

   *
   * - This sort of error is very context heavy. If the packet lengths are short
   *   and numerous and with a consistent format, then the application may be
   *   able to pull out all but the last few packets of data from the buffer and
   *   treat the ones at the end as lost packets.
   *
   * - In most other cases where data lost was crucial, then the whole buffer
   *   may need to be flushed and the data received again.
   *
   * - A way to fix this is to enlarge the receive buffer. This can be done with
   *   dynamic memory allocation, but generally, its better to simply increase
   *   the buffer size by updating the application rather than growing with
   *   need.
